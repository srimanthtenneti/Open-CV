#### Info ####

1) Open-cv has ability to detect faces
2) It uses cascades (programs that return indexes of points in images)
3) We use cv2 functions to get the required property in the image

#### Code In Python ####

import cv2
img = cv2.imread("name.jpg",scale)  # Pass image name and  use 1 for color image and 0 for grayscale image 
cascade = cv2.CascadeClassifier("file.xml") # Name of the cascade
faces = cascade.detectMultiScale(img,
scaleFactor=,
minNeighbors=) # ideal values for scaleFactor = 1.05 , minNeighbors = 5
for x,y,w,h in faces:  # Here x,y-> is pixel index , h is height and w is width
    img = cv2.rectangle(img,(x,y),(x+w,y+h),(0,255,0),3) # here the color of rectangle is in BGR so (0,255,0)
# Now we need to resize the image so 
resize = cv2.resize(img,(int(img.shape[1]/3),int(img.shape[0]/3)))
cv2.imshow("resized image",resize)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

#### Description: ####

-> Here waitKey is a function that keeps the image window open
-> destroyAllWindows is a function that kills all the windows when any key is pressed
